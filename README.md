## Problem
A "lucky number" is one where the digits add up to 7 in successive additions (7 itself also counts as a lucky number). For example, 62431 is a lucky number because 6 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 16, 1 + 6 = 7. Your task will be to write a program that finds all lucky numbers between arg1 and arg2 (both inclusive). Both arguments are required and will be positive integers. Assume that arg1 < arg2.

You will submit two files: a RSpec file and a Ruby file. Your RSpec tests should ensure that the program functions properly for any arguments meeting the above criteria. Don't worry about testing for invalid arguments - the focus should be on the lucky number logic.

Your program should work as follows (arg1 = 100, arg2 = 200):

## To Run Code
In your command line, run `node lucky.js 100 200`

## To Run Tests
In your command line, run `npm test`
